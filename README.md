## Assignment-1 Project planning BEFORE iteration-1:

Checklist/TODOs:
- [x] Update the following during each week prac session
- [x] GitHub's entry timestamp is BEFORE the iteration-1
- [x] User stories are correct
- [x] Must have more user stories than fits into iterations 1 and 2. To practice the priority.

## Plan for iteration-1

Checklist/TODOs:

- [x] [user_stories_dashboard_and_reporting](./user_stories/user_story_dashboard_and_reporting.md), Priority: 5 ( Med ), Estimation: 2 ( 1 day = 5 production days )

## Assignment-2: Iterations

### Iteration 1 [duration 3-4 weeks] (add start and end dates)

- Goal is to have 2 iterations during a trimester of teaching.
- Update the following during each week prac session
- During prac's, you may experiment with using other GitHub ways of tracking changes, e.g. via pull requests.

1. [user_stories_dashboard_and_reporting](./user_stories/user_story_dashboard_and_reporting.md), Priority: 5 ( Med ), Estimation: 2 ( 1 day = 5 production days )
2. [user_stories_inventory_management](./user_stories/user_story_inventory_management.md), Priority: 2 ( high ), Estimation: 4 ( 1 day = 5 production days )
3. [user_stories_user_roles](./user_stories/user_story_user_roles.md), Priority: 2 ( high ), Estimation: 4 ( 1 day = 5 production days )
4. [user_stories_booking_management](./user_stories/user_story_booking_management.md), Priority: High / 2, Estimation: 5 ( 1 day = 5 production days )
5. [user_stories_payments](./user_stories/user_stories_payments.md), Priority: 7 ( Low ), Estimation: 2 ( 1 day = 5 production days )

Estimate: ~17 days (approx. 17 weeks of production time )
Total: YY days
