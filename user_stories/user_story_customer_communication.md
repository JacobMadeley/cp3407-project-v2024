- Integration with external services for email sending and feedback management.
- Guests will expect personalized communication based on their booking details.
- Automated reminders for upcoming bookings are desirable but not mandatory.

## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
Description-v1: Implement a robust communication system to facilitate seamless interaction between MyHotel users (hotel staff) and guests. This system will include automated email notifications for booking confirmations, reminders, and feedback requests. Additionally, a feedback form will be provided for guests to share their experiences and suggestions. Personalization features will be incorporated to tailor communication based on booking specifics.

## Tasks, see chapter 4.

1. Set up integration with an email service provider (e.g., AWS SES) for sending automated notifications.
2. Develop UI components for booking confirmation emails, including relevant booking details and contact information.
3. Design and implement a feedback form accessible to guests post-stay, capturing essential insights for hotel improvement.
4. Configure automated reminders for upcoming bookings, ensuring guests are well-prepared for their stay.
5. Test end-to-end functionality of the communication system, ensuring seamless interaction between users and guests.
6. Document the communication system's features and functionalities for future reference and maintenance.
