## Priority: 10 (e.g. latest for iteration-1)

Operational scalability and UI versatility are prioritized to ensure the booking management system can be easily adopted by a wide range of hotels, from small independents to large chains, by providing a highly adaptable and intuitive interface.

## Estimation: 1 days / 1 week production time

The estimation accounts for the design and implementation of customizable features, UI elements, and testing with a focus on usability and adaptability across different hotel operational practices.
Callum: 1 day

## Assumptions (if any)':'

Hotels have diverse operational practices, room types, and guest engagement strategies that the software must accommodate.
Customization and ease of use in the UI are key factors in the adoption of the software by hotels.
The system should allow for easy configuration to match the specific workflows, terminologies, and services offered by individual hotels or chains.

## Description':'

Develop the booking management system to offer operational scalability and a versatile, customizable UI, ensuring it can adapt to and seamlessly integrate with the varied operational needs and preferences of different hotels.

## Tasks, see chapter 4'.'

Task 1: Conduct user research to identify common and unique operational needs across different types of hotels. Estimation: 2 days
Task 2: Design a customizable UI framework that supports branding and operational workflow adjustments. Estimation: 3 days
Task 3: Implement customizable features and settings for room types, services, pricing models, and communication templates. Estimation: 2 days
Task 4: Develop and integrate the actions / UI

## UI Design':'

No requirement for UI design here. Essentially we need to keep in mind how we can make it reusable among various chains. For instance we could use environment variables for the logo img. / titles or anywhere branding is. We could have theme variables so the theme could be altered to a clients preference.
