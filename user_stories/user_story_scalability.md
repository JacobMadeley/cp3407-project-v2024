# User story: User Roles

## Priority: ~

Having User Roles should be defined and implemented early in iteration 1.
As having appropriate levels of access to users is imperative to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of "My Hotel" and how they manage Guests personal information/ user data as well as assigning the appropriate level of access.

## Estimation: ~

## Assumptions:

* A modern database will be needed to manage User Roles and their appropriate levels of access.
* Administration will have full access to managing new users and assigning them appropriate User Roles for Staff Users.
* Guests will be 'logging in' possibly via a pre-made "My Hotel" assigned account or one made by via a 'sign-up/ create' account process.

## Description:
Define the User Roles for different users of "My Hotel" App/Website and their respective level of access, some of these User Roles could include; Administrators, Reception staff, Housekeeping staff and guests.
Levels of access for these User Roles could include; Admin, Staff, Guest.<br><br>
Having different levels of access associated with User Roles will allow for better managed accounts as well as distinguishing Hotel staff from their Guests.
The use of a database for users will allow for managing their access to other aspects of the App/Website such as Inventory management restricted to Guests but accessible to Staff roles, while another section of 'My Hotel' like Room Status Updates is accessible to all User Roles.

## Tasks:

1. Develop an appropriate Database for 'My Hotel' to manage User Roles and their levels of access.
<br><br>
2. Create an account systems to allow users to login.
<br><br>
3. Allow Administrator roles to create new Staff related roles.
<br><br>
4. Maybe allow for the use of pre-generated Guest accounts be used for users that don't want to set up an account but wants to use the services available to other guests.
<br><br>
5. Allow User Roles to access appropriate services on the 'My Hotel' App/Website.

## UI Design:

* (New, not in the textbook)
* Many user stories are connected to a User interface.
* Insert a mock-up design screenshot using any prototyping tools, e.g. [https://ninjamock.com/](https://ninjamock.com/)

## Completed:

* (New, not in the textbook)
* Insert screenshots of completed iterations.
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iterations), show them all.
