## Estimation: 4 days

* Shang-Ze Lin (Andy Lin): 4 days

## Assumptions (if any):
* Rooms will count as the inventory. 
* Hotels will be able to manage and add their own rooms.
* Hotels can set their room prices individually.

## Description: e.g. The web page will allow the management and tracking of hotel rooms. 
You need to keep all versions here so that your instructor/marker can see your changes easily. 
In a real project, your older versions could be viewed via commits.

Description-v1: e.g. The web page will allow the management and tracking of hotel rooms.
