Create more md files like this one as needed. Place them into the same folder 
as this [user_stories folder](./)

# User story title: e.g. Show current deals

Keep any other version here as well, e.g. Display current deals, Let user to click on "show-current-deals".

## Priority: 10 (e.g. latest for iteration-1)
Any notes on priority go here. 
Note you may have different priorities at different stages of you project.
Again, keep all changes here for marking.

## Estimation: e.g. 2 days
Any notes on estimation go here. Keep your planning poker game numbers. For example
* Bob: 1 day (e.g. estimated before iteration-1)
* Lisa: 2 days
* Jack: 3 days

## Assumptions (if any):

## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
You need to keep all versions here so that your instructor/marker can see your changes easily. 
In a real project, your older versions could be viewed via commits.

Description-v1: e.g. The web site will show current deals to Orion's orbits users

## Tasks, see chapter 4.

1. Task 1, Estimation XX days
2. ...
