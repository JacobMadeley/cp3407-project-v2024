# Testing Explanation
    Unit Testing
    This project uses unit testing throughout the forms to ensure that POST tequests are recieved correctly and information is pulled correctly from the forms and database.
    
    Integration Testing
    As this is a web-app, integration testing is performed thouroughly as each piece of the web-app (forms, pages, urls, database, and backend) all interact constantly. The unit testing assists with this.
    
    System Testing
    A system test was performed prior to deploying the project.
    
    Regression Testing
    Regression testing was performed often, as testing new additions to the code usually required testing all the previous components again due to the structure of the application

    Security Testing
    As security was out of scope for this project, security was not implemented beyond the base Amazon Web service security with VPC and EC2.
    
    Usability Testing
    Useability was tested by a person not part of the project. It yielded some insights about the process of accessing certain parts of the project. It can be unintuitive as to whether you need to be logged in for certain features and logged out for others.
